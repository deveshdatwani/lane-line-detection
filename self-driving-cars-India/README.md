# Driving in Mumbai's western express highway

### Context

Self driving cars are less than 10 years away from becoming quotidian. Yet India seems to be at least 30-40 years away givent the state of infrastructure. This data set pertains to city only and contains a video file capture while driving in Mumbai's western express highway at around midnight. The data set is aimed at building an understanding about India's driving conditions and how self driving cars can be programmed to tackle the challenges that Indian roads throw at them.

This data set is also aimed at answering a very important question. 

*Do we program cars to fit Indian driving conditions already or wait for the infrastructure to match conditions needed for safe operation of self driving vehicles?*
