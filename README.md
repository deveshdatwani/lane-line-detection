Detecting lanes lines on the streets of Mumbai, India.

### Technique 1: Canny edge detection algorithm using OpenCV

"The Canny edge detector is an edge detection operator that uses a multi-stage algorithm to detect a wide range of edges in images. It was developed by John F. Canny in 1986. Canny also produced a computational theory of edge detection explaining why the technique works." - Wikipedia
